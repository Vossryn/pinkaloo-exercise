# Getting Started with this project

There is a client folder and a server folder, each has their own package.json file and need their own `npm install` run in each.

After that is done a `.env` file needs to created in the server folder, and the `API_URL` as well as the `API_KEY` need to be created and populated in it.

If you want to run it in development mode you can create a terminal in each folder and do the `npm run start` command in each folder.

If you want to try and run it 'similar' to a production environment I've included the build folder for the client so all you need to do is do the `npm run start` on the server side.
